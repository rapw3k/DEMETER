# Agriculture Information Model (AIM)

This repository contains the modules comprising all the layers of the Agriculture Information Model (AIM). 

The cross-domain module has been created by reusing and alignment existing standard ontologies/vocabularies,
including: OGC/W3C sosa/ssn, OGC Geosparql, W3C Time ontology, W3C Data Cube ontology, ISO 191xx standards, WGS84, QUDT, W3C PROV-O, as well as well-known vocabularies like FOAF, Schema.org, and Dublin Core.

The domain modules have been created by reusing well-known ontologies and models related to the agri-food sector, namely the ETSI standard [Saref4Agri](https://saref.etsi.org/saref4agri/v1.1.2/) and the underlying Smart Applications REFerence [SAREF ontology](https://saref.etsi.org/core/v3.1.1/), 
[INPIRE/FOODIE ontology](http://agroportal.lirmm.fr/ontologies/FOODIE) and 
[SmartDataModel (aka.FIWARE) agrifood related models](https://smartdatamodels.org/).

The modules include required extensions to cover DEMETER pilot's needs, as well as alignments between elements in these models. The modules have been structured based on topics similar to the FIWARE/SmartDataModels agrifood related models, but in alignment with the DEMEter requirements and the coverage of the re-used models.

> Version 3.0 of AIM has been released (03/2023). It includes:
* Re-alignment to FIWARE, now SmartDataModels, using latest models and the now official URIs
* Re-alignment to SAREF/SAREF4AGRI, using the latest, now official URIs
* Re-use of key FOODON terms
* Re-use of key eCrop terms
* Improve documentation (adding labels and comments for each term)
* Cleaning and harmonization of terms definition
* Updated RDF/XML serialization based on official Turtle resources
* Updated JSON-LD contexts  
* Updated SHACL


> Version 2.0 of AIM has been released. It includes:
* Cross-domain ontology finalized
* Full alignment of cross-domain and domain layers
* JSON-LD context for cross-domain layer 
* Updated JSON-LD contexts for each domain module, including the main context which has been flattened and normalized to include all terms of the cross-domain and domain layer 
* Updated SHACL
* Updated examples

# Examples

There are some examples of how to represent data that is compliant with the AIM. 
Please check examples at [https://github.com/rapw3k/DEMETER/tree/master/models/examples](https://github.com/rapw3k/DEMETER/tree/master/models/examples). In particular:

* simple-farm-instance-AIM_v3.* is a valid instance of a simple farm, in json-ld and turtle respectively

* complex-farm-instance-AIM_v3.* is a valid instance of an complex farm,  in json-ld and turtle respectively, but with invalid datetime values (so SHACL validation reports it)

* instance-bad*-AIM_v3.* are examples that provide errors in SHACL validation

* timeSeries-example1_v3.* is a valid instance to represent time series following sosa/ssn approach (cross-domain)

> Note1: previous examples have been moved to v1.0 folder, and json-ld examples have been slightly modified to include the cross-domain context. 
> Note2: to understand how to use DEMETER AIM context(s) see section "How to create your JSON-LD content using AIM" below.

### Discussion of key terms
The three underlying models have concepts to represent a portion of land where crops or animals are grown, 
and since this is a major concept used in practically all agri applications, we provide here short 
definitions for them, and how they are aligned, so developers will be able to decide which one is 
more suited for their needs.


#### General keywords and terms

* Your json-ld content will have *@graph* entry where you can define multiple objects
* All json-ld objects should have
	- *@id*  key to uniquely identify node objects that are being described in the document with IRIs (urn:demeter:ag:88acd214-f633-4db7-9560-0ca69abc1a4a, or https://myorganization.org/objects/88acd214-f633)
	- *@type* key to set the type of a node or the datatype of a typed value (from the context)
* Use (json-ld) attribute *identifier* to associate the identifier of the object in the application (instead of defining your own, e.g, tractorId, animalId, etc.)

#### Farm related objects
To represent farm area levels (small farm can have only level 1 and level 3)

| Level   | AIM term   | Saref4Agri |   Fiware   |   foodie   |   Adapt   |
| --------|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|----------:|                   
| Level1  | Farm | Farm | AgriFarm | Holding | Farm |
| Level2  | Site | ---  | ---- | Site | --- |
| Level3 	| Plot | Parel | AgriParcel | Plot | Field |
| Level4  | ManagementZone | ---- | ManagementZone | --- |

```
- Level 1
>Reference JSON-LD concept: Farm 

**Saref4Agri:Farm = inspire:Holding = fiware:AgriFarm 
(saref4agri) A plot of land used for the scope of farming which can contain buildings and parcels. (JSON-LD concept: Farm)
(inspire) The whole area and all infrastructures included on it, covering the same or different sites, 
under the control of an operator to perform agricultural or aquaculture activities. (JSON-LD concept: Holding)
(fiware) Harmonised description of a generic farm made up of buildings and parcels. 
This entity is primarily associated with the agricultural vertical and related IoT applications. (JSON-LD concept: AgriFarm)

From FAO: The holding or farm is all the land being utilized in full or in part for agricultural purposes which is located in a single parish. 
The holding or farm may consist of one parcel of land or may be in several parcels. Where it comprises several parcels all parcels must be located 
within the same parish to be considered a single farm. Where parcels are located in several parishes, there will be as many farms as parishes. 
Where a holding straddles (i.e. on the border of) two parishes, the parish where the house/residence or the headquarters is located is to be regarded 
as the parish of location. A farm may comprise land in crops or it may be animals only. Where there are animals only, and no land dedicated to 
their rearing these are referred to as landless farms.

- Level 2 (e.g., LPIS)
Reference JSON-LD concept: Site 

**inspire/foodie:Site
(inspire/foodie) All land at the same or distinct geographic location under the management control of a holding covering activities, 
products and services. This includes all infrastructure, equipment and materials.
Land area used for a type of activity, e.g., arable land, grassland and vineyards. In particular NACE code, 
e.g., A1.1.1 - Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds. 
LPIS data may be imported on the level of <Site> feature which is equal to LPIS farmer's block level.

- Level 3
Reference JSON-LD concept: Plot

**Saref4Agri:Parcel = foodie:Plot = fiware:AgriParcel
(saref4Agri) An area of land, which might be used for grazing animals or planting crops. The parcel is defined as an undividable logical 
area of land which contains homogeneous items (JSON-LD concept: Parcel)
(foodie) A continuous area of agricultural land with one type of crop species, cultivated by one user in one farming mode 
(conventional vs. transitional vs. organic farming) (JSON-LD concept: Plot)
(fiware) Harmonised description of a generic parcel of land. This entity is primarily associated with the agricultural vertical 
and related IoT applications." (JSON-LD concept: AgriParcel)

- Level 4
Reference JSON-LD concept: ManagementZone

**foodie:ManagementZone
(foodie) A spatial subset of a <Plot> that has specific properties like electric conductivity, organic matter, pH, soil texture, soil type or soil nutrients 

```
#### Crops
To represent the crops

| AIM term   | Saref4Agri |   Fiware   |   foodie   |   Adapt   |
|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|----------:|                   
| Crop | Crop | AgriCrop | CropSpecies | CropZone |
| CropType | taxonomic_rank (taxrank vocabulary) | ---- | CropType | Crop |
| cropSpecies (property Crop->CropType) | has_rank (taxrank vocabulary) | ---- | cropSpecies | ---- |
| agroVocConcept (property to agrovoc concept) | ---- | agroVocConcept | ---- | ---- |
| eppoConcept (property to eppo concept) | ---- | ---- | ---- |

```
-- foodie:CropSpecies = saref4Agri:Crop = fiware:AgriCrop
Reference JSON-LD concept: Crop 
Reference JSON-LD property: crop (Plot to Crop)

To associate a crop type:
Reference JSON-LD concept: CropType 
Reference JSON-LD property: cropSpecies (Crop to CropType)

To associate reference agrovoc/eppo concept:
Reference JSON-LD property for agrovoc concept: agroVocConcept
Reference JSON-LD property for eppo concept: eppoConcept
e.g.,
"agroVocConcept": "http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/c_7951",
"eppoConcept": "https://gd.eppo.int/taxon/TRZAX",

```
#### Geospatial properties

To represent the geographical area associated to the land, the following properties are used

```
Reference JSON-LD property: location (to associate countries/regions/municipalities where the land is located or a Point (with lat/long)
Reference JSON-LD property: hasGeometry (to associate the geospatial information (e.g., polygon/multipolygon)

- wgs84_pos:location (generally used to associate countries/regions/municipalities where the land is located) (JSON-LD property: location)

The relation between something and the point, or other geometrical thing in space, where it is.
The range is SpatialThing - anything with spatial extent, i.e. size, shape, or position. e.g. 
people, places, bowling balls, as well as abstract areas like cubes.
For instance, geonames features (countries/regions) like Poznan (https://sws.geonames.org/3088171/) are subclasses of SpatialThing (gn:Feature subclassOf SpatialThing)

- geosparql:hasGeometry (generally used to associate a geometry, e.g., central point or polygon of the land) (JSON-LD property: hasGeometry)

A spatial representation for a given feature.
The range is a Geometry (e.g., Point, Polygon, MultiPolygon, etc.), which has associated the serialization of the geometry, 
typically using the property asWKT to provide the WKT serialization e.g., POLYGON((15.54 50.61,14.14 49.02,17.12 48.32,19.06 49.59,19.76 51.60,15.54 50.61))

- fiware:location (JSON-LD property: locationGeoJson) and fiware:landLocation (JSON-LD property: landLocation) - preferable not used to facilitate interoperability and linked data publication

(location) The geo:json encoded polygon / multi-polygon describing this [entity]. Range is equivalent to GeoProperty
(landLocation). Geometry defining the boundaries of the farm land. Range is equivalent to GeoProperty

```

#### Time series

To represent time series (e.g., multiple observations/measurements over a period of time), we follow the [SOSA/SSN](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/) model and approach. This means that we model each of those observations as a SOSA:Observation, that has associated:
* feature of interest (e.g., Crop, Field, Tractor) (via sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest)
* the observed property (e.g., temperature, density, position) (via sosa:observedProperty)
* the result of the observation (which has a numerical value and a unit) (via sosa:hasResult)
* the time of the observation (via sosa:resultTime) and 
* potentially the sensor used to make the observation (via sosa:madeBySensor).

Please refer to the examples directory for concrete examples.

#### Statistical data
To represent statistica data (e.g., agri indicators), we follow the [RDF data cube](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/) model and approach.

Please use as example the FADN dataset that has been published as linked data in compliance with AIM using the RDF data cube as underlying model [here](https://www.foodie-cloud.org/describe/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fec.europa.eu%2Fagriculture%2Frica%2Fdatabase%2Freports%2Farchives%2Ffadn20200621.zip&sid=6943).

# Finding terms and retrieving annotations 

Developers have different options to find terms in AIM:
* Load whole ontology in ontology editor like Protege [https://w3id.org/demeter/agri](https://w3id.org/demeter/agri), and then search for terms. This may be useful only for those having some basic experience with ontologies.
* All modules of AIM domain layer (e.g., [https://w3id.org/demeter/agri](https://w3id.org/demeter/agri), [https://w3id.org/demeter/agri/agriCrop](https://w3id.org/demeter/agri/agriCrop)) take you to OGC definiton server (using any content negotiation except from TURTLE and RDF/XML). Also using OGC server you can search for terms in all AIM domain modules (cross-domain is not yet there) via [http://defs-dev.opengis.net/demeter/search](http://defs-dev.opengis.net/demeter/search). Also from OGC server many related resources are accessible via content-negotiation-by-profile, using the profile "alt" (linked from HTML views) - e.g. [https://w3id.org/demeter/agri/agriCrop?_profile=alt](https://w3id.org/demeter/agri/agriCrop?_profile=alt). These include JSON-LD schema, HTML documentation views, SHACL constraints and other resources. Use the issue tracker to highlight any issues with these. 
* AIM domain layer is available via agroPortal: [http://agroportal.lirmm.fr/ontologies/DEMETER-AIM](http://agroportal.lirmm.fr/ontologies/DEMETER-AIM). From there you can browse classes, properties or mappgins if any (e.g., [http://agroportal.lirmm.fr/ontologies/DEMETER-AIM?p=classes](http://agroportal.lirmm.fr/ontologies/DEMETER-AIM?p=classes). Additionally, you can use recommendations and annotator functionalities of the portal. These feature are also available via API:
	- *search for terms in AIM (e.g., Plot)*
[http://data.agroportal.lirmm.fr/search?ontologies=http://data.agroportal.lirmm.fr/ontologies/DEMETER-AIM&q=plot](http://data.agroportal.lirmm.fr/search?ontologies=http://data.agroportal.lirmm.fr/ontologies/DEMETER-AIM&q=plot)
	- *search for properties in AIM (e.g., hasAgriParcel)*
[http://data.agroportal.lirmm.fr/property_search?ontologies=http://data.agroportal.lirmm.fr/ontologies/DEMETER-AIM&q=hasAgriParcel](http://data.agroportal.lirmm.fr/property_search?ontologies=http://data.agroportal.lirmm.fr/ontologies/DEMETER-AIM&q=hasAgriParcel)
	- *get annotations (potential terms from AIM) given an input text (e.g., I have a farm that has a parcel with a maize crop and a second parcel with a wheat crop)*
Try it via [http://agroportal.lirmm.fr/annotator](http://agroportal.lirmm.fr/annotator) (select AIM and optionally Agrovoc) or check results [here](http://services.agroportal.lirmm.fr/annotator/?text=I%20have%20a%20farm%20that%20has%20a%20parcel%20with%20a%20maize%20crop%20and%20a%20second%20parcel%20with%20a%20wheat%20crop&ontologies=AGROVOC,DEMETER-AIM&longest_only=false&exclude_numbers=false&whole_word_only=true&exclude_synonyms=false&expand_mappings=false&fast_context=false&certainty=false&temporality=false&experiencer=false&negation=false&score_threshold=0&confidence_threshold=0&display_links=false&display_context=false&apikey=1de0a270-29c5-4dda-b043-7c3580628cd5)


# How to create your JSON-LD content using AIM

JSON-LD is designed around the concept of a "context" to provide mappings from JSON to a shared/common model, allowing applications to use shortcut terms to communicate with one another more efficiently, but without losing accuracy.
The context links terms in a JSON document to elements in an ontology or vocabulary, i.e., AIM in the case of DEMETER.
So, in order to generate AIM-based JSON-LD content, you need to define the @context in your JSON document, and reference AIM context(s) from there.
In general, the simplest method is to specify just the main AIM context as below, which includes all terms in AIM (from the cross-domain and domain layer)

```
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/demeter/agri-context.jsonld",
  ....
}
```

Alternatively, you can use individual contexts, e.g., to use only few modules of AIM. Note that referencing the main context is the same as referencing all individual modules (including cross-domain and domain layer) as shown below. 
Note: there are two ways to reference JSON-LD contexts: i) using the ontology URI+"-context.jsonld" e.g., https://w3id.org/demeter/agri/agriFeature-context.jsonld ; ii) using the ontology URI+profile parameter (thanks to OGC definition server), e.g., https://w3id.org/demeter/agri/agriFeature?_profile=jsoncontext. Nevertheless, second approach still requires some updates to handle issues with entities with duplicated names. So, in the meantime, please use first approach.
 
```
{
  "@context": [
      "https://w3id.org/demeter/agri/crossDomain-context.jsonld",
    	"https://w3id.org/demeter/agri/agriFeature-context.jsonld",
			"https://w3id.org/demeter/agri/agriCrop-context.jsonld",
			"https://w3id.org/demeter/agri/agriCommon-context.jsonld",
			"https://w3id.org/demeter/agri/agriIntervention-context.jsonld",
			"https://w3id.org/demeter/agri/agriAlert-context.jsonld",
			"https://w3id.org/demeter/agri/agriProduct-context.jsonld",
			"https://w3id.org/demeter/agri/agriProperty-context.jsonld",
			"https://w3id.org/demeter/agri/agriSystem-context.jsonld",
			"https://w3id.org/demeter/agri/agriPest-context.jsonld",
			"https://w3id.org/demeter/agri/farmAnimal-context.jsonld"
   ],
   ...
}
```

# How to validate your data is compliant with AIM (particularly the domain layer)

* In order to make sure all elements are valid AIM elements you can use the json-ld playground: [https://json-ld.org/playground/](https://json-ld.org/playground/). 

For instance, you can load one of the examples mentioned above in the JSON-LD Playground [here](https://tinyurl.com/y68qvhhv).

This is not validating the semantics though, just that elements are resolvable.

* In order to validate the semantics, there are different tools we are evaluating still.
The goal is to provide a service for validation, which developers will be able to use from their components, reusing existing solutions if available.  
For now, you can : 
	- use the online tool [https://shacl.org/playground/](https://shacl.org/playground/). However, this tool is not checking some restrictions (e.g., datetime format). New work was moved to library [https://github.com/zazuko/rdf-validate-shacl](https://github.com/zazuko/rdf-validate-shacl)
	- use Apache Jena SHACL [https://jena.apache.org/documentation/shacl/](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/shacl/) - see examples below
	- use [Astrea Web Service](https://astrea.linkeddata.es/). This is a service under testing, but provides a good basis for reusing.

> Note: We have tested a more complete SHACL validator which we recommend for your testing
> The tool is called pySHACL [https://github.com/RDFLib/pySHACL](https://github.com/RDFLib/pySHACL)
> The way to call it would be (see some examples below):
