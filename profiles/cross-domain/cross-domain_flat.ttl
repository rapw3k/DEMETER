A Surface is a 2-dimensional geometric object.
A simple Surface may consists of a single patch that is associated with one exterior boundary and 0 or more interior boundaries. A single such Surface patch in 3-dimensional space is isometric to planar Surfaces, by a simple affine rotation matrix that rotates the patch onto the plane z = 0. If the patch is not vertical, the projection onto the same plane is an isomorphism, and can be represented as a linear transformation, i.e. an affine.
Polyhedral Surfaces are formed by stitching together such simple Surfaces patches along their common boundaries. Such polyhedral Surfaces in a 3-dimensional space may not be planar as a whole, depending on the orientation of their planar normals. If all the patches are in alignment (their normals are parallel), then the whole stitched polyhedral surface is co-planar and can be represented as a single patch if it is connected.
The boundary of a simple Surface is the set of closed Curves corresponding to its exterior and interior boundaries.
A Polygon is a simple Surface that is planar. A PolyhedralSurface is a simple surface, consisting of some number of Polygon patches or facets. If a PolyhedralSurface is closed, then it bounds a solid. A MultiSurface containing a set of closed PolyhedralSurfaces can be used to represent a Solid object with holes.
    """@en,
        """\r
A Surface is a 2-dimensional geometric object.\r
A simple Surface may consists of a single patch that is associated with one exterior boundary and 0 or more interior boundaries. A single such Surface patch in 3-dimensional space is isometric to planar Surfaces, by a simple affine rotation matrix that rotates the patch onto the plane z = 0. If the patch is not vertical, the projection onto the same plane is an isomorphism, and can be represented as a linear transformation, i.e. an affine.\r
Polyhedral Surfaces are formed by stitching together such simple Surfaces patches along their common boundaries. Such polyhedral Surfaces in a 3-dimensional space may not be planar as a whole, depending on the orientation of their planar normals. If all the patches are in alignment (their normals are parallel), then the whole stitched polyhedral surface is co-planar and can be represented as a single patch if it is connected.\r

The physical characteristics of the features themselves are of little interest, except perhaps to the manager of a sampling campaign.EXAMPLE	A .ldq.station.rdq. is essentially an identifiable locality where a sensor system or procedure may be deployed and an observation made. In the context of the observation model, it connotes the .ldq.world in the vicinity of the station.rdq., so the observed properties relate to the physical medium at the station, and not to any physical artefact such as a mooring, buoy, benchmark, monument, well, etc. NOTE	A transient sampling feature, such as a ships-track or flight-line, may be identified and described, but is unlikely to be revisited exactly. A sampling feature is intended to sample some feature of interest in an application domain. However, in some cases the identity, and even the exact type, of the sampled feature may not be known when observations are made using the sampling features. .lt.ul.gt.	.lt.li.gt..lt.b.gt.Classification of sampling features.lt..sl.b.gt..lt..sl.li.gt..lt..sl.ul.gt.A small number of sampling patterns are common across disciplines in observational science. These provide a basis for processing and portrayal tools which are similar across domains, and depend primarily on the geometry of the sample design. Common names for sampling features include specimen, station, profile, transect, path, swath, and scene. These are classified primarily by their topological dimension. Point-located samples are defined in this Clause, extensive samples of various dimensions in Clause 9 and specimens in Clause 10." .
